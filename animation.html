      <P>
           The campus of the prestigious Indian university was once a bustling hub of students, researchers, and professors. But now, it lies abandoned and desolate, its buildings and structures in ruins. The only sounds that echo through its halls are the eerie creaks of rotting wood and the occasional rustle of the wind through broken windows.

Once upon a time, the university was at the forefront of medical research, conducting groundbreaking experiments and studies that promised to change the world. But one day, something went horribly wrong. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but rumors persist that the scientists and researchers working on a top-secret project accidentally unleashed a deadly virus that spread rapidly throughout the campus.

As the virus swept through the halls of the university, panic and chaos ensued. Students and faculty alike were infected and turned into mindless, bloodthirsty creatures. The university quickly became a scene of unspeakable horror, as the infected rampaged through the campus, tearing apart anyone in their path.

The government quickly stepped in, attempting to contain the outbreak by quarantining the university and its surroundings. But it was too late. The virus had already spread beyond the walls of the campus, infecting the nearby town and beyond. Eventually, the government was forced to abandon the area entirely, leaving the university and its infected inhabitants to rot.

Now, years later, the campus remains a haunting reminder of the horrors that occurred there. Few dare to venture inside its walls, afraid of what they might find. But whispers persist that the virus still lingers within the ruins, waiting to infect any who dare to enter. And so, the university remains a place of darkness and dread, a warning to all those who would tamper with forces beyond their control.
